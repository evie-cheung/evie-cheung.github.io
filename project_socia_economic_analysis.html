    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Jupyter Notebook</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Discovered that unemployment is moderately correlated with social instability (suicides and crime), while higher tertiary education rates are linked to lower unemployment. Income inequality showed a weak negative correlation with social issues.</p>
